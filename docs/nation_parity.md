# Nation Feature Parity Checklist

This checklist compares the Sponge remake’s nation systems with Spigot Towny, highlighting areas that already align with the original gameplay loop and the major gaps that remain.

## Nation parity highlights (Sponge port)

* **Richer nation model** – Nations now store government type, assistants, flat/percentage tax mode, spawn cost, and staff lists alongside existing capital/ally/enemy data, giving the command layer access to the same core levers Spigot exposes.【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/object/Nation.java†L18-L218】
* **Government switching** – `/nation government <type>` lets leaders choose between the bundled government presets using autocompleted choices, persisting the selection to disk and broadcasting the change.【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationSetGovernmentExecutor.java†L23-L75】
* **Tax management** – `/nation taxes` mirrors Spigot’s flat/percent workflow, validating amounts against the configured maximum and storing the toggle on the nation object.【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationTaxesExecutor.java†L19-L107】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/ConfigHandler.java†L154-L166】
* **Assistant staffing** – Nation assistants can now invite/kick towns, manage allies/enemies, edit the board/tag, toggle public/open/neutral status, and handle deposits/withdrawals in line with Spigot expectations.【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/object/Nation.java†L240-L253】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationAssistantExecutor.java†L23-L99】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationInviteExecutor.java†L24-L87】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationAllyExecutor.java†L40-L105】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationEnemyExecutor.java†L40-L105】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationSetBoardExecutor.java†L34-L55】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationSetTagExecutor.java†L34-L74】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationToggleExecutor.java†L19-L99】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationDepositExecutor.java†L23-L89】【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationWithdrawExecutor.java†L23-L105】
* **Information panel parity** – `/nation info` now prints government, tax mode, spawn cost, assistant roster, and relation lists so players see the same metadata they expect on Spigot.【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/Utils.java†L335-L414】

## Remaining Nation gaps

* **War & conquest systems** – Nation sieges, wartime scoring, and conquest rewards remain unimplemented despite the richer data model, leaving diplomacy limited to invites and alliances.【F:docs/spigot_parity_review.md†L41-L55】
* **Government modifiers** – Government selection currently changes flavour text only; Spigot’s production/tax modifiers per government type still need logic hooks in upkeep, war, and plot calculations.【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/object/Nation.java†L18-L218】【F:docs/spigot_parity_review.md†L41-L44】
* **Rank/mode integration** – Assistant rank handling doesn’t yet drive resident modes or broadcast cues for diplomatic actions, so additional feedback parity work is required.【F:src/main/java/com/arckenver/towny/cmdexecutor/nation/NationInviteExecutor.java†L24-L87】【F:docs/spigot_parity_review.md†L41-L55】
